        <h1>UX/UI CASE STUDY</h1>
        <p>Edgar’s Mission is a not for profit sanctuary
          for rescued farmed animals that seeks to
          create a humane and just world for humans
          and non-humans. Our initial impressions of
          the site were.</p>

      <h2 class="heading--orange">Why we pick Edgar’s?</h2>
      <p class="section-body-content">As a group of three we all love animals, they’re near and dear to our hearts.
        We’re
        all from Victoria and we
        found that supporting a small state NFP would be ideal for us. Design wise we chose Edgar’s mainly because of
        the
        potential we saw in the website, most of the content is there, however design wise it can use a bit of a
        shuffling
        that we are all looking forward to redesign.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading--orange">What seems to be the problem?</h2>
    <div class="case-study-section">
      <p class="section-body-content">During our heuristic evalution, we think the current Edgar Mission website feel
        cluttered and there is too much
        happening, which prevents users from focusing what they objectives are. The text heavy and poor information
        hierarchy are also overwhelming and making users hesitant to donate on the website or even use the site itself.
        HOW MIGHT WE help to make the webiste to be more applealing and enhance users experince.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study-section">
      <h2 class="heading--green">The solution</h2>
      <p class="section-body-content">The Edgar’s Mission website was designed to gain support via donations but we have
        observed based on their social
        media, our research and stakeholder interview, that the most popular attraction is sanctuary tours and
        donations.
        Therefore alongside donations we chose to improve the booking
        experience on the site and make the website mobile friendly.</p>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p class="section-body-content">We kicked off our project with User Research, in order to gain a clear
          understanding of Edgar Mission
          potential
          problems. Our theory was the donation and booking are the main objectives of the website for users to visit.
          However, those features seem preventing users to interact with them seamlessly. We then conducted user
          testing,
          stateholder interview and research their social media review to collect more supportive data</p>
      </div>
      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p class="section-body-content">We conducted a total of 4-5 recorded semi-constructed interviews to get a more
          spontaneous reaction from the
          participants. Our goal was to see if there were any hurdles that hindered the user from donating as well to
          find
          out the users first impression of the site.</p>

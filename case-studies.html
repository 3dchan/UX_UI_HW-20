          for rescued farmed animals that seeks to
          create a humane and just world for humans
          and non-humans. Our initial impressions of

      <h2 class="heading--orange">Why we pick Edgar’s?</h2>
      <p class="section-body-content">As a group of three we all love animals, they’re near and dear to our hearts.
        We’re
        all from Victoria and we
        found that supporting a small state NFP would be ideal for us. Design wise we chose Edgar’s mainly because of
        the
        potential we saw in the website, most of the content is there, however design wise it can use a bit of a
        shuffling
        that we are all looking forward to redesign.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading--orange">What seems to be the problem?</h2>
    <div class="case-study-section">
      <p class="section-body-content">During our heuristic evalution, we think the current Edgar Mission website feel
        cluttered and there is too much
        happening, which prevents users from focusing what they objectives are. The text heavy and poor information
        hierarchy are also overwhelming and making users hesitant to donate on the website or even use the site itself.
        HOW MIGHT WE help to make the webiste to be more applealing and enhance users experince.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study-section">
      <h2 class="heading--green">The solution</h2>
      <p class="section-body-content">The Edgar’s Mission website was designed to gain support via donations but we have
        observed based on their social
        media, our research and stakeholder interview, that the most popular attraction is sanctuary tours and
        donations.
        Therefore alongside donations we chose to improve the booking
        experience on the site and make the website mobile friendly.</p>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p class="section-body-content">We kicked off our project with User Research, in order to gain a clear
          understanding of Edgar Mission
          potential
          problems. Our theory was the donation and booking are the main objectives of the website for users to visit.
          However, those features seem preventing users to interact with them seamlessly. We then conducted user
          testing,
          stateholder interview and research their social media review to collect more supportive data</p>

      <div class="case-study-section">
        <h2>User Testing</h2>
        <p class="section-body-content">We conducted a total of 4-5 recorded semi-constructed interviews to get a more
          spontaneous reaction from the
          participants. Our goal was to see if there were any hurdles that hindered the user from donating as well to
          find
          out the users first impression of the site.</p>

    <h2>Card Sorting & Information Architecture</h2>
    <p class="section-body-content">The Edgar’s Mission website was cluttered with duplicate navigation items, while the
      overall experience felt flat and boring. To solve this, we planned to reorganize the site map with the goal of
      making the visual design more trustworthy, intimate, and visually stimulating.</p>
    <p class="section-body-content">We referenced results from the card sorting activity to identify content patterns,
      group like items together, and label new categories. By removing duplicate navigation items and re-label few
      categories, we were able to build a site map that was more structured and comprehensive.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="section-body-content">Final Thought
      When we first looked at the site as a group we had a couple things to say, it was outdated, information hierarchy
      was all over the place and so on. Assumptions can only go so far, hard research, from user testing articles,
      checking thecompany background, talking to stakeholders and more helped us gain confidence in our design choices.
    </p>
    <p class="section-body-content">Keep moving forward
      This was a 3 week project, we had to move fast. It was the one pain point we had to address immediately,
      stakeholder isn't responding? Do user research? User persona isn't done? That's fine we have notes and can make
      one later?</p>
    <p class="section-body-content">Future Opportunities
      We would love to tweak the high fidelity design a bit more. In particular the color scheme to bemore red/green
      color blind friendly as well as some additional UI changes.</p>
